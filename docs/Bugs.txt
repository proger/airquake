GLES Quake Known Bugs and Limitations

- No sound or music.
- No Internet (or telephone network) multiplayer. (WiFi-based local multiplayer works.)
- Controls have not been adapted to the Android handset.

- The keyboard controls are hard-wired to the Android TMobile G1 keyboard layout.

- The HELP/ORDERING menu item automatically runs timedemo1. (Useful for benchmarking, not so great for
  getting help.)
