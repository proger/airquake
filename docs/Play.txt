These are the instructions for playing Quake.

These instructions assume you've already put the Quake apk and data files on your Android device.


Running Quake
-------------

Turn on the device

Look for Quake in the Activities folder. Launch it as you would any other activity.
It will take up to thirty seconds to start running.

When Quake starts running it will display a console with some debug information, then
go into an "attract mode" loop.

Starting a game:

Press space bar to bring up the main menu.
The "Quake icon" should be next to the "Single Player" menu item. Press the
"Enter" button twice to start the game.

Controls:

The Quake controls are customizable, depending upon the settings of config.cfg,
but the defaults are:
