    a) the Quake.apk file
    b) the data files on the sdcard

Use the Phone UI to uninstall the Quake apk:

    Press Home Key
    Press Menu Key
    Select Settings
    Select Applications
    Selct Manage Applications
    Select Quake
    Press "Uninstall"

Make sure your device is not mounted as an USB Storage Device:
    Press Home button on Phone
    Press Menu
    Select "SD card & phone storage

Then run this script to delete the Quake files on the sdcard:
