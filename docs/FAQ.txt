GLES Quake Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Why isn't GLES Quake available on the Android Marketplace?

A: Unfortunately the license terms of the Android Marketplace do not permit
shareware, and id Sofware does not provide a non-shareware version of the
nescessary game data.

Q: Why isn't there any sound?

A: Streaming audio is not currently supported by the NDK, and I have not
investigated whether it would be possible to use the Android Java sound APIs
from within the NDK.

Q: Why isn't Internet multiplayer supported?

A: This is a port of glQuake, not glQuakeWorld, so it does not handle
Internet multiplayer. I chose to port glQuake because I wanted to
be able to run the "timedemo" demos for timing OpenGL driver performance.

Q: Why don't you include the pak0.pak game data file in the source code?

A: Because that file is owned by id Software.

Q: Where can I find a copy of pak0.pak?

A: You could try to track down a copy of the original id Software DOS shareware
version of Quake, which at one time was available on the id Software
FTP servers. Or you could buy a copy of Quake and use the pak file from
the commercial version.

Q: Why did you port Quake to the Android platform?

A: I ported Quake as a test of the Android OpenGL ES drivers, and as a test
of the Android Native Development Kit.

Q: Do you plan to port any other version of Quake, such as QuakeWorld, Quake 2, Quake 3?

A: No, I'll let someone else have the glory. :-)

Q: Have you ported Quake to other platforms?

A: Yes, I did a port to Direct3D about 10 years ago. (Search for dxquake on SourceForge.)
